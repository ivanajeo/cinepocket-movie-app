# CinePocket Movie App ðŸŽ¬ 
Built with **Expo**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, this app fetches real-time movie data and ranks titles using a custom popularity algorithm powered by **Appwrite**.  

From smooth navigation to responsive design, it delivers a seamless browsing experience â€” letting users discover, search, and explore movies with an intuitive, visually appealing interface.

This project doesnâ€™t just *show movies* â€” it tracks engagement, processes data, and adapts in real time to highlight whatâ€™s trending. 


## Features
- **Real-time movie data** â€” Always fresh, always accurate.  
- **Home page** â€” Featured & discover sections.  
- **Search page** â€” Find your favorites instantly.
- **Movie details page** â€” Deep-dive into each film with synopsis, ratings, and more.  
- **Custom popularity algorithm** â€” Tracks user searches and trends.  
- **Responsive design** â€” Optimized for all devices.  
- **Reusable architecture** â€” Clean, maintainable codebase.
  
## Tech Stack
- **Expo** â€” Universal app development for Android, iOS, and Web, with fast refresh, native APIs, and file-based routing.
- **React Native** â€” Component-based mobile UI framework with deep native integration.
- **Appwrite** â€” Backend-as-a-service for authentication, databases, storage, and serverless functions.
- **TypeScript** â€” Static typing for cleaner, more maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS + NativeWind** â€” Utility-first styling for consistent, responsive mobile UI.

## What I Learned ðŸ§ 
This project was a deep dive into both **frontend** and **backend** skills:

- Different navigation patterns (**stack** & **tab**).  
- Advanced file-based routing (nested & dynamic routes).  
- Custom hooks for cleaner, reusable logic.  
- Responsive design for mobile devices.  
- Working with APIs to fetch and process live data.  
- Using a database to store and query movie data.  
- Creating algorithms to determine trending movies.  

Building this app from scratch was an incredible experience â€” combining design, logic, and data into a single, polished product.ðŸ˜Š
